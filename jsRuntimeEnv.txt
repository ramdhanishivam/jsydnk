1. JS runtime environment contains all elements required to run JS.
2. It contains JS engine, set of API's, callback queue, microtask queue, event loop.
3. JS engine is a piece of code.
4. Process includes Parsing ---> Compilation -----> Execution.
5. Parsing breaks code into tokens and converts it into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
6. Modern JS engine follows JIT compilation, it interprets while it optimises code as much as it can.
7. Execution and Compilation are done together.
8. Execution has Garbage collector and other optimisation such as inlining, copy elusion, inline caching etc.
9. Fell in love with JS. 

Basic idea about Mark & Sweep Algo(Garbage collection):
It comprise of 2 phases - 
1. Mark phase
2. Sweep phase

All objects are marked as 0 initially (at creation) and in mark phase the objects that will be accessible are marked as 1 (reachable) by a DFS graph traversal.

During sweep phase, the objects marked with 0 are removed from heap memory. and also all reachable objects are again initialized with 0 (made unreachable) because the algorithm will run again.

So, it's basically tracing garbage collector concept. :)
